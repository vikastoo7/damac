== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes, It captures the country code with a phone number. But it's only supported with single-page form (not in multistep). This feature is available in the pro version.

= Is it working with the auto-detect country flag? =
Yes, It will work in all popular browsers. In the opera browser, you have to disable ad-block. Opera browser doesn't send data to the plugin and it will not work. You can check more info from here.
